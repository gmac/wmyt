lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_000,nathan,"Interesting! It seems that we are under the pond next to the house."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_001,nathan,"It's some kind of sophisticated chair."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_002,nathan,"It looks like someone was searching for something here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_003,coppelius,"Fortunately I got rid of everything that might be useful for Vincent."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_004,nathan,"That would be a bad idea."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_005,nathan,"They're just a lot of boring books."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_006,coppelius,"Watch your tongue, young man."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_007,nathan,"Sorry."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_008,nathan,"These books do not spark my interest."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_009,coppelius,"Hey, would you like me to come over to your place and tell you what I think about your things?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_010,nathan,"Sure... if I should ever have my own secret room filled with boring books, then I'll invite you. I'm sure you'd like that."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_011,coppelius,"........."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_019,nathan,"Are these mathematical formulas?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_020,coppelius,"Something like that."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_021,nathan,"These formulas are way over my head."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_022,nathan,"There are a couple of flasks. Some of them are broken."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_023,nathan,"Useless."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_024,coppelius,"Unless you know how to use them ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_025,nathan,"The radio is on."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_026,nathan,"Not right now."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_027,nathan,"I don't want to make Dr. Coppelius angry."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_028,nathan,"They're nothing special."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_030,nathan,"May I take some of these papers?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_031,coppelius,"You may not."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_032,nathan,"Someone left all these papers on the floor."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_034,coppelius,"Don't touch my papers!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_035,nathan,"Ok, ok. Don't worry."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_036,nathan,"It's some sort of plan..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_037,coppelius,"It's the construction plan for a wireless phone."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_038,coppelius,"I wonder how long it took Vincent to realize that it's useless."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_039,coppelius,"... of course it's impossible to build a wireless phone."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_041,coppelius,"Take your hands off that plan!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_043,nathan,"It's a mysterious and massive metal pod."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_044,nathan,"It's very rusty."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_045,nathan,"Maybe there's something locked inside, that shouldn't be set free."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_046,coppelius,"Maybe not, Nathan."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_047,nathan,"There's nothing inside ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_048,nathan,"But it's really cozy in here!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_049,nathan,"I wonder what happens when I press this little red button here..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_050,coppelius,"Me too ....."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_051,nathan,"What!?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_052,nathan,"That's the tunnel I escaped through."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_053,nathan,"No thanks, my first pass through that shaft was bad enough."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_054,vincent,"Coppelius!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_055,coppelius,"None other!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_056,nathan,"You're Dr. Coppelius? ... but ... then who is he?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_057,coppelius,"Nothing but a thief and a traitor. Vincent, I won't let you steal my invention!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_058,vincent,"Trust me, old man, I'll find it. I've collected dozens of them."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_059,vincent,"You and your colleagues should have accepted my offer to join me."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_060,vincent,"After I've stolen your plans and inventions, I'll take over the country and you'll be wiped away. Haha!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_061,coppelius,"I'll never allow my work to fall into your hands. No righteous man would ever join you, Vincent!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_062,vincent,"I'll find your invention, Coppelius! Sooner or later I'll find it!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_063,nathan,"It's DR. Coppelius."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_064,FLASH,"---"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_065,nathan,"What happened? Where did he go? Hey, someone stole all my things!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_066,coppelius,"Vincent walked out of the room while we were unconscious."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_067,coppelius,"He locked us in here ... We have to get out!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_068,nathan,"Dr. Coppelius...?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_069,nathan,"Could this be Dr. Coppelius? He looks more sinister than I expected."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_070,nathan,"Excuse me, are you Dr. Coppelius?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_071,vincent,"I've expected you... I knew he was going to send someone in here, but someone like you? A little desperate - the old man!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_072,nathan,"What are you talking about?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_073,vincent,"You're nothing but a puppet! If you weren't so insignificant, I would tear you apart and put you back together again..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_074,vincent,"I could even purge your memories and whisper new ones into your empty brain."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_075,vincent,"Then you'd serve me and execute my commands. See? You could still become useful - isn't that just wonderful?!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_076,nathan,"No ... who are you?!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_077,nathan,"I'd better avoid roughing up random strangers."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_078,nathan,"There's a group of scientists ... mh..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_079,nathan,"Hey, you're pictured here, too."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_080,coppelius,"Indeed, I am."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_081,nathan,"No, I'll leave it here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_082,nathan,"It's some kind of tank that is connected to the pod."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_083,nathan,"There's a flammability symbol painted on the side."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_084,nathan,"How? Maybe I can put something in there ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_085,nathan,"I'll put the burning leaflet into the tank."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_086,nathan,"Don't try this at home, kids!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_087,nathan,"It seems that I've started a fire within the tank."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_088,nathan,"Is that a good thing?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_089,nathan,"Good idea... if I could just start a fire in the boiler, then this could make it hotter."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_094,nathan,"How? Maybe I can put something else in there."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_095,nathan,"I'll put the rest of the alcohol into the tank."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_096,nathan,"I'll put in these seeds, too."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_097,nathan,"This should burn, too."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_100,nathan,"I've put quite enough into that boiler."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_101,nathan,"Dr. Coppelius, I was sent to find you."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_102,coppelius,"I know, I know. The university wants to know if I'm still alive."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_103,nathan,"Yes. I'm supposed to tell you that you are in great danger!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_104,coppelius,"Well, I know that! That's why I had to hide. I guess my old colleagues were worried enough that they sent you to find me."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_105,nathan,"What kind of danger are you in?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_106,coppelius,"I knew Vincent was after me... I had to hide to protect my invention. My granddaughter would be in great danger, too, if Vincent found out about my invention."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_107,nathan,"Nora?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_108,coppelius,"Yes, Nora ... I promised to look after her."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_109,nathan,"Who is Vincent?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_110,coppelius,"Well, do you see that old photograph over there? Have a look at it and I'll tell you ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_111,nathan,"What invention was Vincent talking about?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_112,coppelius,"After many years of research I was able to construct  that what scientists dream to achieve since generations ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_113,coppelius,"I constructed a mechanical heart!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_114,nathan,"A mechanical heart?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_115,coppelius,"Yes! A mechanical heart could be the motor for every kind of device ... it's very effective. It just needs a small amount of electric energy."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_116,coppelius,"Imagine ... a mechanical heart that keeps a tank rolling, providing the energy for planes, beating in the chest of a robot man..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_117,coppelius,"... or in the chest of a sick young girl."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_118,nathan,"What do you mean? "
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_119,nathan,"Wait ... Nora??"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_120,coppelius,"Yes! She was the reason I invested thousands of hours into research ... she was very sick."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_121,coppelius,"The only prototype that ever worked was not perfect ... from time to time the device needs to be adjusted ... but it helped my granddaughter Nora to survive."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_122,nathan,"Now I understand why you wanted to keep your invention a secret. If Vincent knew about it then ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_123,coppelius,"... Nora would be in great danger! Yes."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_124,nathan,"But why did you come here? Why risk running into Vincent?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_125,coppelius,"When I left I forgot some notes that could help me to keep Nora from getting sick. I didn't know that Vincent was already here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_126,nathan,"Then why did you want me to get into the house?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_127,coppelius,"Well, I don't know how Vincent got in... but I tried to make it as complicated as possible to get down here. Unfortunately I couldn't remember how to get in here myself ... it seems I'm getting too old."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_128,nathan,"What is this place?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_129,coppelius,"This is my research laboratory."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_130,coppelius,"About two years ago I heard that Vincent was after our discoveries and that several members of our research team had disappeared."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_131,coppelius,"We tried to stay in contact via radio and mail but after I lost one contact after the other I decided that it's better to leave and to destroy everything that might be useful for Vincent and his evil plans."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_132,nathan,"So that's why the university doesn't know where you are?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_133,coppelius,"Exactly."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_134,nathan,"How do we get out of here?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_135,coppelius,"Well, that escape pod over there would be an option, but ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_136,nathan,"Escape? That sounds perfect!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_137,coppelius,"Yes ... well ... it has its quirks."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_138,nathan,"How can I use it?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_139,coppelius,"Maybe you're right, we don't have a choice."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_140,coppelius,"First you'll have to get get a fire started in the boiler ... then put in anything that might burn. Anything that contains alcohol would help."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_141,coppelius,"That should generate enough steam to activate the pod."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_142,nathan,"First: Start a fire. Second: Put in highly flammable things ... I should be able to do that."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_143,nathan,"I'll try to get us out of here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_144,coppelius,"Very good."
