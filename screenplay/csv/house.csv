house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_000,nathan,"It's a waterwheel."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_001,nathan,"It reads, ""Wanderer's Path""."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_002,nathan,"I could follow the sign... It's pointing south."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_003,nathan,"It's the house from the photograph! This is where Dr. Coppelius used to live."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_004,nathan,"It looks a little worn-out ..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_005,nathan,"Hello! Is someone in there?"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_006,nathan,"Apparently no one is home."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_007,nathan,"Hmm. Nora said that her grandfather was around this house. I don't see any signs of him though..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_008,nathan,"Perhaps he went the other way? Nora said that they were meeting McManus down at the pier."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_009,nathan,"I have to find Nora's grandfather... she needs his help!"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_010,nathan,"It looks a little bit older now, but this is definitely the house in the picture."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_011,nathan,"There's no glass. Just bricks and paint."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_012,nathan,"Bricks and paint... the windows were closed years ago."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_013,nathan,"The clock hands are missing."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_014,nathan,"I have no idea what time it is."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_015,nathan,"There's no use for a clock without hands."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_016,nathan,"It's a rough mat to wipe your shoes on."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_017,nathan,"There's something under the doormat."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_018,nathan,"There's a tiny key hidden underneath..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_021,nathan,"Hmmm. It seems too small to be a real key."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_023,nathan,"It's the entrance door to the house."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_024,nathan,"Is anyone home? Hello?"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_025,nathan,"It's firmly locked."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_026,nathan,"I should try to get in there and warn the doctor."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_027,nathan,"Good idea, but the wire doesn't even fit into the keyhole."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_028,nathan,"That alone doesn't fit."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_031,nathan,"This key is still incomplete."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_034,nathan,"The key to match the lock. Finally."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_035,nathan,"It's an iron gate with a raven depicted on it."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_036,nathan,"It's locked."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_037,nathan,"Hmm... maybe I can pick the lock?"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_038,nathan,"This should be able to pick the lock..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_039,nathan,"It's open!"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_040,nathan,"It's a piece of cloth tied to a long stick. It makes some kind of flag or sign."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_041,nathan,"Ok. I'll do that."
