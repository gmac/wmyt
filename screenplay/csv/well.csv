well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_000,nathan,"It's the long way back to the village."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_001,nathan,"I can't leave. Not yet."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_002,nathan,"It's dead."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_003,nathan,"The dry branches would make perfect firewood."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_004,nathan,"It's an old bridge, but the wood still looks strong and trustworthy."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_005,nathan,"I can only use it to get to the other side."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_006,nathan,"That cart has seen better days..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_007,nathan,"I wonder who left you here."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_008,nathan,"I can't use it. It's definitely broken."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_009,nathan,"Is that a coffin? Creepy."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_010,nathan,"It looks like it was opened from inside..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_011,nathan,"I'm not going in there!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_012,nathan,"There's something shiny stuck between the boards."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_013,nathan,"What's this?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_014,nathan,"It's the well handle."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_015,nathan,"Ooops!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_016,nathan,"It's the handle from the well."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_017,nathan,"Okay. It might be useful."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_018,nathan,"It's an old well."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_019,nathan,"Hello!? Is anyone down there?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_020,well,"..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_021,nathan,"No one is answering. Good."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_022,nathan,"I should use the handle."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_024,nathan,"It broke when I touched it."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_028,nathan,"It's a nice lantern."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_029,nathan,"I don't want to. I don't like darkness."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_030,nathan,"No, it's already lit."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_031,nathan,"It looks like he's on a hiking trip."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_032,nathan,"Excuse me..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_033,greg,"Why hello!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_034,nathan,"No."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_035,nathan,"I don't want to duel him!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_037,nathan,"Those are nice looking mushrooms."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_038,nathan,"No, they might be poisonous."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_039,nathan,"I have no idea what kind of mushrooms these are."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_040,nathan,"I should only take what I really need."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_041,nathan,"It's a crow."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_042,nathan,"Someone has tied a golden chain with a key to his leg."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_043,nathan,"Hi there."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_044,nathan,"Come on ... you don't need this key, right?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_045,nathan,"No. He's going to bite my fingers off, I know it."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_046,nathan,"Try this, my friend."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_047,nathan,"It seems that he likes them... and I do believe that he looks slightly tired now."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_048,nathan,"How about another delicious and crunchy sedative seed?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_049,nathan,"He definitely looks tired now."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_050,nathan,"How about one more delicious and crunchy sedative seed?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_051,nathan,"Hmm... I guess he flew away to take a nap."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_052,nathan,"I'll have to find him."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_053,nathan,"A dry branch."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_055,nathan,"There's no light."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_056,nathan,"Now it's open."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_057,nathan,"That should work, but I'll have to open the lantern first."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_059,nathan,"It's already open."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_060,nathan,"Nice warm light."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_062,nathan,"No. I really don't like darkness."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_063,nathan,"There's no need to do that anymore."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_065,nathan,"I'm Nathan. Who are you?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_066,greg,"Hi Nathan. I'm Gregory, a traveller."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_067,nathan,"A pleasure to meet you. May I call you Greg?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_068,greg,"...Er, sure."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_069,nathan,"Where are you off to, Greg?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_070,greg,"Right now I'm heading to Leipzig to meet my friend, Matthew."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_071,greg,"We have a street performance act that we're taking on the road!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_072,nathan,"Neat, what's your act?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_073,greg,"I juggle fire while Matthew tells adventurous short stories."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_074,nathan,"Wow, that sounds great!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_075,greg,"Who knows, maybe you'll catch our act someday."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_076,nathan,"Are you connected to the mystery that surrounds this remote area?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_077,greg,"I don't think so, but I may be able to help."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_078,greg,"Whenever I ponder a mystery, I crack a can of soda to help me think."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_079,greg,"Here, try this!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_080,nathan,"Wow, thanks! A can of Dr. Pepper, my favorite!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_081,greg,"No problem, mate!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_082,nathan,"Do you know a Dr. Coppelius?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_083,greg,"Sorry, I can't help. I'm just passing through these parts."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_084,nathan,"So ... you don't know him?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_085,greg,"Can't say that I do."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_086,nathan,"Okay, just thought I'd ask."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_087,nathan,"So, you're sure you don't know a Dr. Coppelius?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_088,greg,"Still no."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_089,nathan,"I see."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_090,nathan,"Well, I gotta go."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_091,greg,"See ya, Nathan!"
