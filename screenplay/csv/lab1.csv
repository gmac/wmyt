lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_001,nathan,"It seems there's an island near the coast."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_002,nathan,"I don't think I need that right now."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_003,nathan,"""Note to self - don't forget: Vincent will come for you too. Leave before he does and take everything with you that he might find useful. Hide."""
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_004,nathan,"""PS: don't tell Nora, it's far too dangerous. You promised to look after her."""

lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_006,nathan,"Eh, no."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_007,nathan,"""Note to self - Danger! Don't use pod prototype. Chance to survive escape is minimal."""
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_008,nathan,"What's that supposed to mean?"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_010,nathan,"They're empty."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_011,nathan,"There's nothing in them."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_012,nathan,"It's a box with bird food."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_013,nathan,"No thanks."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_014,nathan,"No thanks. I've had my fill of birdseed."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_017,nathan,"I can't reach it from here."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_018,nathan,"""Phosphorus and Lily"". An impressive oil painting."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_019,nathan,"It's called ""Britt's Place""."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_020,nathan,"That's a pair of binoculars."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_021,nathan,"Mh ... puedo ver el embarcadero."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_022,nathan,"Nora, the sailor, and his dog are down there."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_023,nathan,"It seems that Vincent doesn't want us to follow him."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_024,nathan,"He's closed the entrance."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_025,nathan,"I can't go up there. The secret entrance was closed."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_026,nathan,"I guess it can only be opened from the other side."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_027,nathan,"It's closed."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_028,nathan,"It's locked."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_030,nathan,"It's not locked!"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_031,nathan,"Hey, I found some of the things that Vincent stole from me!"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_032,nathan,"At least I have some of my things back."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_033,nathan,"Now I just need to get out of here."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_034,nathan,"It's empty."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_035,nathan,"I'll leave it be."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_036,nathan,"I can see the sea out there ..."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_037,nathan,"This place must be somewhere below the cliff."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_038,nathan,"It's a framed photograph of a bearded man wearing a cowboy hat."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_039,nathan,"Who are you looking at, gringo?"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_040,nathan,"Hey, there was something hidden behind the picture."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_041,nathan,"There's a small circular arrow painted next to the hole."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_042,nathan,"Something's missing here..."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_043,nathan,"That seems to fit."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_044,nathan,"This handle should work to open the gate."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_045,nathan,"Here we go..."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_046,nathan,"Hey, it worked!"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_047,nathan,"I could open the gate if only I could reach the handle."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_048,nathan,"I can't reach it..."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_050,nathan,"Hmm. The crow seems to be Dr. Coppelius' pet bird."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_051,nathan,"He's still sleeping."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_052,nathan,"WAKE UP!"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_054,nathan,"He's awake."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_055,nathan,"Come here. Come, come."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_056,nathan,"Remember me? I made you sleepy..."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_057,crow,".........."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_058,nathan,"Well, at least he seems to be listening to me."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_059,nathan,"Come on, come to Uncle Nathan!"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_060,nathan,"Thanks, my friend. You've been a really helpful crow."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_061,nathan,"Looks like he had enough sleep. I'm glad he's well."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_063,nathan,"Too bad, I can't get a good view of those paintings beyond it."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_064,nathan,"How can I open it?"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_066,nathan,"It won't move."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_067,nathan,"Vincent locked us in here ... that devil!"
