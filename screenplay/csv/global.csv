global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_000,nathan,"I don't see anything special about that."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_001,nathan,"No, thanks."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_002,nathan,"What should I do with it?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_003,nathan,"How should I use this?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_004,nathan,"I don't think that's useful."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_005,nathan,"I don't think that'll work."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_006,nathan,"I think that's useless."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_007,nathan,"It's a piece of barbed wire."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_008,nathan,"It's thin and sharp. Maybe I can pick a lock with this?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_009,nathan,"The title of the book is ""The Inside Matters"" ... What does that mean?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_010,nathan,"Let's see... Hey! There's a golden plate inside."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_011,nathan,"I'll discard the empty book and just keep the plate."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_012,nathan,"It's a corked bottle of alcohol."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_013,nathan,"I pulled the cork out with my teeth."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_014,nathan,"The cork is too tight to pull out with my hands."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_015,nathan,"That won't uncork it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_016,nathan,"It's almost empty."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_017,nathan,"I'm not in the mood for drinking right now."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_019,nathan,"Alcohol is never a good solution for problems."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_020,nathan,"It's a full bottle of alcohol."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_024,nathan,"Half-full or half-empty? That's the question."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_028,nathan,"It's a piece of cloth."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_029,nathan,"I could try to clean something... but the cloth is too dry."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_030,nathan,"Now it's a wet piece of cloth soaked in alcohol."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_031,nathan,"I could clean something..."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_032,nathan,"That doesn't need to be cleaned."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_033,nathan,"It's a light cork."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_034,nathan,"It's the fish I caught."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_035,nathan,"I'm really sorry about this, fish. I've never liked fishing, you know."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_036,nathan,"I don't like raw fish."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_037,nathan,"A dead fish isn't needed here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_038,nathan,"It's my handmade fishing-rod. With bait."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_039,nathan,"I should go fishing."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_040,nathan,"This is not a good place for fishing."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_041,nathan,"It's my handmade fishing rod."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_042,nathan,"I should go fishing, but I'll need to bait the hook first."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_044,nathan,"Plus I need to bait the hook."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_045,nathan,"It's a glove. I need a second one to make a pair."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_046,nathan,"How should I use a single glove?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_049,nathan,"It's a pair of gloves."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_050,nathan,"I don't want to wear them all the time."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_051,nathan,"It's the handle from the well."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_052,nathan,"I have to use it with something."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_053,nathan,"It's a small and sharp metal hook."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_054,nathan,"Ouch! It's sharp."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_055,nathan,"It's ""Captn Matt's Guide to Life"". Looks interesting. I should try reading it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_056,nathan,"""Chapter 27: How to stun a Raven."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_057,nathan,"""On one of my travels through the Caribbean it became necessary to drug a raven. """
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_058,nathan,"""Should you get into a similar situation just follow these instructions."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_059,nathan,"""First get some kind of nice looking bird food, some strong alcohol and finally add the SETA DE MUERTE. The Mushroom of Death (not deadly)."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_060,nathan,"""Mix the three ingredients in a cup or bowl. Now give the cereal to the raven. Feed the bird until it falls asleep."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_061,nathan,"""After that you can proceed with whatever you were doing - just like I continued to search for the Voodoo Priest. For further details see Chapter 51 ‘Coco Island’"""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_062,nathan,"Hey, I think that's a useful hint. Mix cereal, alcohol and Mushroom of Death. I think I got it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_063,nathan,"I should read the book instead."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_064,nathan,"It seems to be a part of a larger key."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_065,nathan,"A single part of a key is rather useless."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_067,nathan,"These two parts fit together. But there's still a part missing."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_068,nathan,"An incomplete key is rather useless."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_070,nathan,"A complete three-part key. Whatever this unlocks, it must be important."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_071,nathan,"The key doesn't fit here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_072,nathan,"I can't use the key here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_076,nathan,"This is only a part of a larger key."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_085,nathan,"It's a leaflet from the local fishing club. It says:"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_086,nathan,"""The wonderful art of fishing has captured our hearts and imaginations for decades."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_087,nathan,"""In our childhood, all it took was a long stick, a string, a float, a hook and some bait."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_088,nathan,"""Come and join our happy circle of fishermen."""
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_089,nathan,"Happy circle of fishermen, eh?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_090,nathan,"You use leaflets by reading them... or by throwing them away."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_091,nathan,"It's a leaflet from the local fishing club, and it's burning."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_092,nathan,"That's not good fire safety."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_093,nathan,"That doesn't need fire."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_094,nathan,"It's my lighter."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_095,nathan,"Hi there, lighter."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_096,nathan,"I don't smoke, but maybe I can use it for something else."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_097,nathan,"I won't burn this. I'm really careful with fire since that one incident."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_098,nathan,"It's the legendary mushroom of death. That's funny, these dots look like a small skull."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_099,nathan,"No!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_100,nathan,"It's a picture of the house where Dr. Coppelius used to live. I was sent to tell him that he's in great danger."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_101,nathan,"I don't even know what kind of danger the old men at the university were talking about, but Coppelius is supposed to contact them."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_102,nathan,"I wonder if Coppelius still lives there. Well, I should try to find out."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_103,nathan,"It's an oval-shaped golden plate depicting grim death himself."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_104,nathan,"I hope it's not cursed or something."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_105,nathan,"It's an oval-shaped golden plate depicting a young adventurer."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_106,nathan,"It's some muddy piece of metal."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_107,nathan,"I'm not cleaning this with my tongue!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_108,nathan,"I can't clean it with my hands. The mud is dry and hard."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_109,nathan,"That won't get it clean."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_110,nathan,"These are green seeds that I made by mixing mushroom and alcohol with wheat."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_111,nathan,"They smell like medicine."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_112,nathan,"No, I don't want to get sleepy."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_113,nathan,"That doesn't need to be drugged."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_126,nathan,"It's a cocktail shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_127,nathan,"I could shake and mix something, but what?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_129,nathan,"I've put wheat in it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_130,nathan,"I should only mix a complete recipe."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_132,nathan,"I've put the wheat and alcohol into it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_135,nathan,"I've put the mushroom, wheat and alcohol into it. That's it!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_136,nathan,"Ok, I'll mix it!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_138,nathan,"I've put the mushroom and wheat in it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_141,nathan,"I've put alcohol into it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_144,nathan,"I've put the mushroom and alcohol into it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_147,nathan,"I've put the mushroom in it."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_149,nathan,"Wow! An unopened can of Dr Pepper."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_150,nathan,"I love Dr Pepper."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_151,nathan,"I'd like to, but I have to open it first."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_152,nathan,"Good idea. The can is opened."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_153,nathan,"I won't waste my Dr. Pepper here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_154,nathan,"Tastier than a red potion!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_155,nathan,"And more refreshing than a green herb!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_156,nathan,"There's nothing left, but I still have the good taste on my tongue. Mh."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_157,nathan,"I'll keep it intact. Maybe I can use it later."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_158,nathan,"It's open! The smell, the sound. Wonderful."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_159,nathan,"Cheers!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_162,nathan,"It's a long stick."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_163,nathan,"How could I use this?"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_164,nathan,"A stick with a cork on a string."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_165,nathan,"It looks like a whip with a cork... So far it's useless."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_166,nathan,"There's no need to do that."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_167,nathan,"A stick with a hook on a string. Hey! It looks like a fishing-rod."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_168,nathan,"I need something to make the hook float in the water."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_170,nathan,"I affixed the string to the long stick."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_171,nathan,"It looks like a whip; but I know it's not a whip. So far it's useless."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_173,nathan,"It's a string."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_174,nathan,"No, I was never very good at cat's cradle."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_175,nathan,"It's a string with a cork."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_176,nathan,"It's a string with a cork and a hook."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_177,nathan,"It's a string with a hook."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_178,nathan,"Nice wheat."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_179,nathan,"No, that looks rather like bird food."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_181,nathan,"There's no need for wheat here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_182,nathan,"A cute little fella. Hey, I think he's looking at me."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_183,nathan,"It seems that he knows I'm up to something."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_184,nathan,"I'm not sure what I'll do with you ... Maybe it's something bad, so I'll apologize in now advance."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_185,nathan,"Sorry, worm."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_186,nathan,"He wriggles."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_187,nathan,"No, I think I'll keep him here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_188,nathan,"I'll pour some alcohol on the cloth."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_189,nathan,"The cloth is already soaking wet."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_191,nathan,"Now I have a pair."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_192,nathan,"Hey, these parts fit together!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_193,nathan,"The key is now complete."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_201,nathan,"Now playing with fire might really be useful."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_202,nathan,"Are you insane?! You make me sick..."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_203,nathan,"That's too dry to clean the mud off."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_204,nathan,"Now it's clean."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_205,nathan,"I'll add it to the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_214,nathan,"I'll put some wheat into the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_215,nathan,"I'll pour some alcohol into the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_216,nathan,"I'll put the mushroom into the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_217,nathan,"I'll attach it to the string."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_219,nathan,"Good idea, but I'll need a float to make a fishing rod."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_222,nathan,"I'll attach the string to the stick."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_230,nathan,"I could go fishing, but first I'd need a proper fishing rod."
