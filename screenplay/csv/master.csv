cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_000,nathan,"That was scary, hu?"
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_001,nathan,"But don't worry, I'm still alive!"
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_002,nathan,"Thank goodness I was thrown out of the pod seconds before it hit the ground."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_003,nathan,"Now I need to get back to the lab and free Dr. Coppelius!"
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_004,nathan,"That was scary, uh?"
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_007,nathan,"Now I should get back to the house and free Dr. Coppelius!"
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_008,nathan,"There's a lighthouse off in the distance... but no light."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_009,nathan,"A boat is at anchor in the bay."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_010,nathan,"There's an old pier on the other side of the bay."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_011,nathan,"There's a piece of string caught in the branches."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_012,nathan,"A piece of string can be useful!"
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_013,nathan,"It's a sundial."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_014,nathan,"There's no sunlight, so I can't tell what time it is."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_015,nathan,"He's asleep. It seems that my sedatives worked."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_016,nathan,"I guess I can take the key now."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_017,nathan,"Okay, I have the key."
cliff,lib/cliff_voice.swf:cliff_019,nathan,"No. He deserves some rest."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_000,nathan,"Over there is a lighthouse."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_001,nathan,"It's too far away. They wouldn't hear me."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_002,nathan,"I don't think I'll hike over there ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_003,nathan,"It was a massive stone bridge. It's collapsed."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_004,nathan,"I think that way leads to that village I saw on the map at home ... Ravenhollow."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_005,nathan,"I can't cross the bridge."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_006,nathan,"Ah, the sea."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_007,nathan,"No, the water looks really cold."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_008,nathan,"I've never done this before..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_009,nathan,"I guess I won't need that stupid fishing rod anymore."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_010,sailor,"I would have paid fifty bucks for it."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_011,nathan,"I'll just pretend like I didn't hear that."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_012,nathan,"I'll need to bait the hook before I can try fishing."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_013,nathan,"I'll need a float and bait before I can try fishing."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_014,nathan,"This fishing tackle is still incomplete."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_016,nathan,"Seems like there was a ferry coming here once."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_017,nathan,"Must have been a long time ago. I can't read the timetable anymore."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_018,nathan,"I can't read it. Even if I could it would still be useless."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_019,nathan,"I'm sure the ferry doesn't come here anymore."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_020,nathan,"It's a leaflet from the local fishing club."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_021,nathan,"I'll take it. I doubt anyone else needs it."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_022,nathan,"The leaflet was pinned to the board with a small fishing hook."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_023,nathan,"Somehow I feel like someone is watching me..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_024,nathan,"I'll have to take the long way through the fields ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_025,nathan,"There's a boat at anchor."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_026,sailor,"Aye. That's me ship, the ""Sea Cucumber""."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_027,nathan,"Excuse me! May I borrow your boat?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_028,sailor,"Sorry. I can't lend you my boat."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_029,sailor,"Shroom and me, we'll have to get going soon..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_030,sailor,"We have to deliver these boxes before sunrise."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_031,nathan,"It's a rowboat."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_036,nathan,"He's asleep."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_037,nathan,"It looks like he's running in his dream."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_038,shroom,"..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_039,nathan,"Hey old boy!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_040,nathan,"Want to help me?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_041,sailor,"Old Shroom is tired. He won't help you if you have nothin' to offer."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_042,nathan,"What would he like to have?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_043,sailor,"He's a sailor, like me. Therefore he loves fish... Just like me."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_044,sailor,"Right boy?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_046,nathan,"I'll let him sleep."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_047,nathan,"Here, I heard you like fish..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_048,nathan,"Good idea ... but I think he's too tired."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_049,nathan,"It seems that I have his attention now."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_050,nathan,"Shroom, old chap. How are you?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_052,nathan,"That's great to hear."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_053,nathan,"I'd better not."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_054,nathan,"Ahem ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_055,nathan,"Shroom! Come on, old boy! Find the SETA DE MUERTE!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_056,nathan,"See? ... the name is in this book here! Have a good look at it."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_057,nathan,"Wow, Shroom found a mushroom."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_058,nathan,"How convenient that it was hidden right under his nose."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_064,nathan,"No, he's done enough."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_065,nathan,"He looks a little dangerous."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_066,sailor,"What did you just say?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_067,nathan,"Nothing! Sorry!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_068,nathan,"Excuse me..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_069,nathan,"I don't think so."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_073,nathan,"How did Nora get here?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_074,sailor,"Her grandfather brought her and told me to wait for him."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_075,nathan,"Her grandfather? What did he look like?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_076,sailor,"Well, he looks a little bit like the first Doctor Who."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_077,nathan,"Who?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_078,sailor,"Aye! Just like him."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_079,nathan,"I'm confused."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_081,nathan,"Okay."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_082,nathan,"It's an old glove."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_083,nathan,"Ok."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_084,nathan,"The crab is living in an old glove."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_085,nathan,"Nature never fails to impress me."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_086,nathan,"Hey ... nice weather, hu?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_087,crab,"......."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_088,nathan,"It seems he's not interested in small talk."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_089,nathan,"It seems that he doesn't want to leave the glove."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_090,nathan,"Maybe I could persuade him to move out somehow..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_091,nathan,"Good idea, but the can is closed and full of Dr. Pepper."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_092,nathan,"Good idea, but the can is full of Dr. Pepper."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_093,nathan,"Well, maybe I could give away an empty can."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_094,nathan,"Let's see ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_095,nathan,"Now the crab is living comfortably in a Dr. Pepper can."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_096,nathan,"He has a good taste."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_100,nathan,"No. He's had more than enough adventures for one day."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_101,nathan,"It seems she's not feeling well."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_102,nathan,"Nora, may I ask you something?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_103,nora,"Not right now please, Nathan."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_104,nathan,"Sorry."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_105,nathan,"That wouldn't be nice."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_106,nathan,"These boxes contain unmarked bottles."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_107,nathan,"It smells like strong whiskey."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_108,nathan,"I'll take one."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_109,sailor,"No, you won't."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_111,nathan,"Right, I won't."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_112,nathan,"Well, he said I can have one..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_113,nathan,"I've already taken my share."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_114,nathan,"Hi, I'm Nathan. And you are ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_115,sailor,"I'm Martin Munchkin McManus."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_116,nathan,"Is your name really ""Munchkin""?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_117,sailor,"Aye."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_118,nathan,"Your parents must have liked ""The Wizard of Oz""."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_119,sailor,"I have no idea what you are talking about, kid."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_120,nathan,"Is your name really Martin ""Munchkin"" McManus?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_124,nathan,"Is that your dog?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_125,sailor,"Aye. T'is me mate."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_126,nathan,"What is his name?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_127,sailor,"His name is Shroom. Right boy?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_129,nathan,"Shroom? As in Mushroom?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_130,sailor,"Aye. He's a mushroom searching kind of dog."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_131,nathan,"Really?! I've heard of those!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_132,sailor,"Aye. If you show old Shroom here the name of the mushroom that you're searching for, he'll be on his feet in a second to find it for you."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_133,nathan,"He has to see it written down somewhere? That means he can read, too! Wow."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_135,nathan,"You said your dog can find mushrooms?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_137,nathan,"Fascinating..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_138,nathan,"I'm kind of stuck right now. Can you help?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_139,sailor,"I've been at the shores of Africa, I've wrestled the boxers of China, and I've seen the ghost of the pirate captain Stoertebecker."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_140,sailor,"...but still the most useful ideas and hints I've ever found are in the book ""Capt'n Matt's Guide to Life""."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_141,sailor,"Here, I happen to have a copy that I could give you."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_142,nathan,"Wow, thanks! ""Capt'n Matt's Guide to Life"". This sounds good. Sometimes I need guidance."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_143,sailor,"Aye. We all do, kid."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_144,nathan,"Don't you need this book? It sounds like it's important to you."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_145,sailor,"Aye. It is, but I have about fifty more copies at home. You can keep it, boy."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_146,nathan,"So giving me this copy won't diminish your collection?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_147,sailor,"Naw, I like to give them to strangers whenever possible. It spreads the word."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_148,nathan,"It's dark. You are standing at an old pier. Alone. With a couple of boxes containing unlabeled bottles of alcohol."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_149,nathan,"Hey! Are you doing something illegal?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_150,sailor,"Aye aye."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_151,nathan,"May I have a bottle?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_152,sailor,"Aye. Take one. Ten percent of the goods are meant to be used to bribe officials and those who know too much."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_154,nathan,"Aren't you afraid that I'm going to report you?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_155,sailor,"No. You've officially been bribed."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_156,nathan,"I guess you're right. And I might need a bottle."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_157,nathan,"So you aren't afraid that I'm going to report your shady activities?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_158,sailor,"No. I said you could take a bottle. You've been officially bribed."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_160,nathan,"Bye."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_161,nathan,"How are you?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_163,nathan,"Do you know what time it is?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_164,shroom,"......"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_165,nathan,"That late?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_000,nathan,"It has a nice golden color."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_001,nathan,"I can hear crickets. I guess they live somewhere in there."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_002,nathan,"That's a good idea. I'll take some wheat."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_003,nathan,"I already have enough wheat."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_008,nathan,"The barrel is full of old tins and tools."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_009,nathan,"It's all rusty and useless."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_010,nathan,"Except, maybe, for that cocktail shaker on top."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_011,nathan,"It's a cocktail shaker, and it seems to be in good shape... unlike the rest of this scrap metal."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_012,nathan,"Alright."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_013,nathan,"Nice bench. It looks comfortable."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_014,nathan,"I don't want to rest now."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_015,nathan,"There are still mysteries to solve and plots to unfold."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_016,nathan,"It's a single glove."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_017,nathan,"Sorry, does this glove belong to you?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_018,nora,"No, it was already here when I came."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_019,nathan,"Good. Then I'll take it."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_020,nora,"Why? Is it your glove?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_021,nathan,"Uh ... yes?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_022,nora,"Then why did you ask if it's mine?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_023,nathan,"... to test your honesty?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_024,nathan,"You passed the test! Congratulations."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_025,nathan,"I'll take the glove, okay?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_026,nora,"*Sigh* Go ahead."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_027,nathan,"There's a scarecrow watching over this field."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_028,nathan,"If I were a bird, I'd be terrified."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_029,nathan,"It's pretty much useless... and far too big to pick up."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_030,nathan,"The sign says ""Path to Sea""."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_031,nathan,"There's some larger tools and bundles of wood. Nothing useful, I guess."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_032,nathan,"No, these tools are too heavy."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_033,nathan,"Mh ... it's a stone."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_034,nathan,"Hey, there's a wriggly worm under that stone!"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_035,nathan,"It's a worm. He's wriggling."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_036,nathan,"Okay. I have the worm."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_037,nathan,"Who's he?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_038,nathan,"Excuse me..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_039,nathan,"Who's she?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_040,nathan,"Ahem ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_041,nathan,"That wouldn't be very nice."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_042,nathan,"Something seems terribly wrong with Nora ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_043,nathan,"Are you alright, Nora?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_044,nora,"I ... I don't feel well ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_045,nora,"Please find my grandfather, Nathan ... he'll know what to do. See if he's around that house over there."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_046,GOODBYE,"Please hurry Nathan. Mr. McManus has to take grandfather and I back home. I ... I need my medicine."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_048,nathan,"Don't worry, Nora. I'll find your grandfather!"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_049,GET KEY,"And tell my grandfather that I found this ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_051,nathan,"Is this some sort of key?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_052,nora,"I think so. I assume it has something to do with that house my grandfather was trying to get into."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_053,nathan,"Okay, I'll look around that house for your grandfather."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_054,HAS KEY,"What was I supposed to do with this key part?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_056,nora,"Please give it to my grandfather ... he was trying to find a way into that house."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_058,nathan,"It's a fence of barbed wire."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_059,nathan,"I've got enough barbed wire."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_060,nathan,"Good idea, I may need some barbed wire..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_061,nathan,"But I'll need something to protect my hands to free it."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_062,nathan,"A single glove is rather useless."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_063,nathan,"I hear gloves are usually used in pairs..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_064,nathan,"Like shoes, you know."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_068,nathan,"Who's your grandfather? What's his name?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_069,nora,"I'm not supposed to talk about him, sorry Nathan."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_070,nathan,"What is your grandfather doing here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_071,nora,"He has some business to do around here."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_072,nathan,"What kind of business?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_073,nora,"I'm not quite sure."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_074,nora,"He doesn't say much about his work... but he did tell me not to talk about him or his work with strangers."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_075,nora,"Actually, he told me not to talk to strangers at all."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_076,nathan,"But we can talk because I introduced myself, right?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_077,nora,"Right."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_078,nathan,"Isn't it kind of boring here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_079,nora,"I think it's nice ... and I have something to read while I'm waiting."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_080,nathan,"What are you reading?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_081,nora,"Mungo Park: ""Travels in the Interior of Africa"". I got it from my grandfather..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_082,nora,"That Mungo Park was a real adventurer."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_083,nathan,"What are you reading again?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_084,nora,"Mungo Park: ""Travels in the Interior of Africa""."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_085,nathan,"I've learned enough about you, I think."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_086,nathan,"Who are you and what are you doing here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_087,nora,"I'm Nora. I was reading as you might have noticed."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_088,nora,"But If you must know: I'm waiting for my grandfather."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_090,nathan,"Do you know a Dr. Coppelius?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_091,nora,"Why do you ask?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_092,nathan,"I was sent to tell him that he's in danger."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_093,nora,"In danger?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_094,nathan,"Yes. I don't know why, but he's supposed to contact the university immediately."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_095,nora,"I wish I could help you... but I've been asked not to talk about him. Sorry."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_096,nathan,"So you know him?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_097,nora,"Please, I can't answer that."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_098,nathan,"Okay, sorry."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_099,nathan,"You know, I can run really fast."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_100,nora,"I'm excited to hear that."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_101,nathan,"Really?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_102,nathan,"Bye."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_103,nathan,"I'm Nathan. Who are you?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_104,coppelius,"Young man, I am someone who knows that you don't belong here... so what are you doing here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_105,nathan,"I'm searching for a Dr. Coppelius."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_106,coppelius,"Oh really? That's quite interesting, I must say."

global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_182,nathan,"A cute little fella. Hey, I think he's looking at me."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_183,nathan,"It seems that he knows I'm up to something."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_184,nathan,"I'm not sure what I'll do with you ... Maybe it's something bad, so I'll apologize in now advance."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_185,nathan,"Sorry, worm."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_186,nathan,"He wriggles."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_187,nathan,"No, I think I'll keep him here."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_188,nathan,"I'll pour some alcohol on the cloth."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_189,nathan,"The cloth is already soaking wet."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_191,nathan,"Now I have a pair."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_192,nathan,"Hey, these parts fit together!"
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_193,nathan,"The key is now complete."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_201,nathan,"Now playing with fire might really be useful."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_202,nathan,"Are you insane?! You make me sick..."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_203,nathan,"That's too dry to clean the mud off."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_204,nathan,"Now it's clean."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_205,nathan,"I'll add it to the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_214,nathan,"I'll put some wheat into the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_215,nathan,"I'll pour some alcohol into the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_216,nathan,"I'll put the mushroom into the shaker."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_217,nathan,"I'll attach it to the string."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_219,nathan,"Good idea, but I'll need a float to make a fishing rod."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_222,nathan,"I'll attach the string to the stick."
global,lib/global_voice.swf:global_230,nathan,"I could go fishing, but first I'd need a proper fishing rod."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_000,nathan,"It's a waterwheel."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_001,nathan,"It reads, ""Wanderer's Path""."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_002,nathan,"I could follow the sign... It's pointing south."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_003,nathan,"It's the house from the photograph! This is where Dr. Coppelius used to live."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_004,nathan,"It looks a little worn-out ..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_005,nathan,"Hello! Is someone in there?"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_006,nathan,"Apparently no one is home."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_007,nathan,"Hmm. Nora said that her grandfather was around this house. I don't see any signs of him though..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_008,nathan,"Perhaps he went the other way? Nora said that they were meeting McManus down at the pier."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_009,nathan,"I have to find Nora's grandfather... she needs his help!"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_010,nathan,"It looks a little bit older now, but this is definitely the house in the picture."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_011,nathan,"There's no glass. Just bricks and paint."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_012,nathan,"Bricks and paint... the windows were closed years ago."

house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_015,nathan,"There's no use for a clock without hands."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_016,nathan,"It's a rough mat to wipe your shoes on."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_017,nathan,"There's something under the doormat."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_018,nathan,"There's a tiny key hidden underneath..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_021,nathan,"Hmmm. It seems too small to be a real key."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_023,nathan,"It's the entrance door to the house."

house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_025,nathan,"It's firmly locked."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_026,nathan,"I should try to get in there and warn the doctor."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_027,nathan,"Good idea, but the wire doesn't even fit into the keyhole."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_028,nathan,"That alone doesn't fit."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_031,nathan,"This key is still incomplete."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_034,nathan,"The key to match the lock. Finally."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_035,nathan,"It's an iron gate with a raven depicted on it."

house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_038,nathan,"This should be able to pick the lock..."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_039,nathan,"It's open!"
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_040,nathan,"It's a piece of cloth tied to a long stick. It makes some kind of flag or sign."
house,lib/house_voice.swf:house_041,nathan,"Ok. I'll do that."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_000,nathan,"It's a map of this part of Ravenhollow Bay."

lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_026,nathan,"I guess it can only be opened from the other side."

lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_042,nathan,"Something's missing here..."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_043,nathan,"That seems to fit."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_044,nathan,"This handle should work to open the gate."

lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_046,nathan,"Hey, it worked!"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_047,nathan,"I could open the gate if only I could reach the handle."

lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_060,nathan,"Thanks, my friend. You've been a really helpful crow."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_061,nathan,"Looks like he had enough sleep. I'm glad he's well."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_063,nathan,"Too bad, I can't get a good view of those paintings beyond it."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_064,nathan,"How can I open it?"
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_066,nathan,"It won't move."
lab1,lib/lab1_voice.swf:lab1_067,nathan,"Vincent locked us in here ... that devil!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_000,nathan,"Interesting! It seems that we are under the pond next to the house."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_001,nathan,"It's some kind of sophisticated chair."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_002,nathan,"It looks like someone was searching for something here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_003,coppelius,"Fortunately I got rid of everything that might be useful for Vincent."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_004,nathan,"That would be a bad idea."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_005,nathan,"They're just a lot of boring books."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_006,coppelius,"Watch your tongue, young man."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_007,nathan,"Sorry."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_008,nathan,"These books do not spark my interest."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_009,coppelius,"Hey, would you like me to come over to your place and tell you what I think about your things?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_010,nathan,"Sure... if I should ever have my own secret room filled with boring books, then I'll invite you. I'm sure you'd like that."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_011,coppelius,"........."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_019,nathan,"Are these mathematical formulas?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_020,coppelius,"Something like that."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_021,nathan,"These formulas are way over my head."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_022,nathan,"There are a couple of flasks. Some of them are broken."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_023,nathan,"Useless."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_024,coppelius,"Unless you know how to use them ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_025,nathan,"The radio is on."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_026,nathan,"Not right now."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_027,nathan,"I don't want to make Dr. Coppelius angry."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_028,nathan,"They're nothing special."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_030,nathan,"May I take some of these papers?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_031,coppelius,"You may not."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_032,nathan,"Someone left all these papers on the floor."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_034,coppelius,"Don't touch my papers!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_035,nathan,"Ok, ok. Don't worry."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_036,nathan,"It's some sort of plan..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_037,coppelius,"It's the construction plan for a wireless phone."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_038,coppelius,"I wonder how long it took Vincent to realize that it's useless."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_039,coppelius,"... of course it's impossible to build a wireless phone."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_041,coppelius,"Take your hands off that plan!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_043,nathan,"It's a mysterious and massive metal pod."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_044,nathan,"It's very rusty."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_045,nathan,"Maybe there's something locked inside, that shouldn't be set free."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_046,coppelius,"Maybe not, Nathan."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_047,nathan,"There's nothing inside ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_048,nathan,"But it's really cozy in here!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_049,nathan,"I wonder what happens when I press this little red button here..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_050,coppelius,"Me too ....."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_051,nathan,"What!?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_052,nathan,"That's the tunnel I escaped through."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_053,nathan,"No thanks, my first pass through that shaft was bad enough."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_054,vincent,"Coppelius!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_055,coppelius,"None other!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_056,nathan,"You're Dr. Coppelius? ... but ... then who is he?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_057,coppelius,"Nothing but a thief and a traitor. Vincent, I won't let you steal my invention!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_058,vincent,"Trust me, old man, I'll find it. I've collected dozens of them."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_059,vincent,"You and your colleagues should have accepted my offer to join me."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_060,vincent,"After I've stolen your plans and inventions, I'll take over the country and you'll be wiped away. Haha!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_061,coppelius,"I'll never allow my work to fall into your hands. No righteous man would ever join you, Vincent!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_062,vincent,"I'll find your invention, Coppelius! Sooner or later I'll find it!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_063,nathan,"It's DR. Coppelius."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_064,FLASH,"---"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_065,nathan,"What happened? Where did he go? Hey, someone stole all my things!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_066,coppelius,"Vincent walked out of the room while we were unconscious."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_067,coppelius,"He locked us in here ... We have to get out!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_068,nathan,"Dr. Coppelius...?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_069,nathan,"Could this be Dr. Coppelius? He looks more sinister than I expected."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_070,nathan,"Excuse me, are you Dr. Coppelius?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_071,vincent,"I've expected you... I knew he was going to send someone in here, but someone like you? A little desperate - the old man!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_072,nathan,"What are you talking about?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_073,vincent,"You're nothing but a puppet! If you weren't so insignificant, I would tear you apart and put you back together again..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_074,vincent,"I could even purge your memories and whisper new ones into your empty brain."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_075,vincent,"Then you'd serve me and execute my commands. See? You could still become useful - isn't that just wonderful?!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_076,nathan,"No ... who are you?!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_077,nathan,"I'd better avoid roughing up random strangers."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_078,nathan,"There's a group of scientists ... mh..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_079,nathan,"Hey, you're pictured here, too."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_080,coppelius,"Indeed, I am."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_081,nathan,"No, I'll leave it here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_082,nathan,"It's some kind of tank that is connected to the pod."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_083,nathan,"There's a flammability symbol painted on the side."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_084,nathan,"How? Maybe I can put something in there ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_085,nathan,"I'll put the burning leaflet into the tank."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_086,nathan,"Don't try this at home, kids!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_087,nathan,"It seems that I've started a fire within the tank."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_088,nathan,"Is that a good thing?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_089,nathan,"Good idea... if I could just start a fire in the boiler, then this could make it hotter."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_094,nathan,"How? Maybe I can put something else in there."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_095,nathan,"I'll put the rest of the alcohol into the tank."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_096,nathan,"I'll put in these seeds, too."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_097,nathan,"This should burn, too."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_100,nathan,"I've put quite enough into that boiler."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_101,nathan,"Dr. Coppelius, I was sent to find you."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_102,coppelius,"I know, I know. The university wants to know if I'm still alive."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_103,nathan,"Yes. I'm supposed to tell you that you are in great danger!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_104,coppelius,"Well, I know that! That's why I had to hide. I guess my old colleagues were worried enough that they sent you to find me."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_105,nathan,"What kind of danger are you in?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_106,coppelius,"I knew Vincent was after me... I had to hide to protect my invention. My granddaughter would be in great danger, too, if Vincent found out about my invention."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_107,nathan,"Nora?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_108,coppelius,"Yes, Nora ... I promised to look after her."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_109,nathan,"Who is Vincent?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_110,coppelius,"Well, do you see that old photograph over there? Have a look at it and I'll tell you ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_111,nathan,"What invention was Vincent talking about?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_112,coppelius,"After many years of research I was able to construct  that what scientists dream to achieve since generations ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_113,coppelius,"I constructed a mechanical heart!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_114,nathan,"A mechanical heart?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_115,coppelius,"Yes! A mechanical heart could be the motor for every kind of device ... it's very effective. It just needs a small amount of electric energy."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_116,coppelius,"Imagine ... a mechanical heart that keeps a tank rolling, providing the energy for planes, beating in the chest of a robot man..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_117,coppelius,"... or in the chest of a sick young girl."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_118,nathan,"What do you mean? "
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_119,nathan,"Wait ... Nora??"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_120,coppelius,"Yes! She was the reason I invested thousands of hours into research ... she was very sick."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_121,coppelius,"The only prototype that ever worked was not perfect ... from time to time the device needs to be adjusted ... but it helped my granddaughter Nora to survive."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_122,nathan,"Now I understand why you wanted to keep your invention a secret. If Vincent knew about it then ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_123,coppelius,"... Nora would be in great danger! Yes."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_124,nathan,"But why did you come here? Why risk running into Vincent?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_125,coppelius,"When I left I forgot some notes that could help me to keep Nora from getting sick. I didn't know that Vincent was already here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_126,nathan,"Then why did you want me to get into the house?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_127,coppelius,"Well, I don't know how Vincent got in... but I tried to make it as complicated as possible to get down here. Unfortunately I couldn't remember how to get in here myself ... it seems I'm getting too old."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_128,nathan,"What is this place?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_129,coppelius,"This is my research laboratory."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_130,coppelius,"About two years ago I heard that Vincent was after our discoveries and that several members of our research team had disappeared."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_131,coppelius,"We tried to stay in contact via radio and mail but after I lost one contact after the other I decided that it's better to leave and to destroy everything that might be useful for Vincent and his evil plans."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_132,nathan,"So that's why the university doesn't know where you are?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_133,coppelius,"Exactly."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_134,nathan,"How do we get out of here?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_135,coppelius,"Well, that escape pod over there would be an option, but ..."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_136,nathan,"Escape? That sounds perfect!"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_137,coppelius,"Yes ... well ... it has its quirks."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_138,nathan,"How can I use it?"
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_139,coppelius,"Maybe you're right, we don't have a choice."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_140,coppelius,"First you'll have to get get a fire started in the boiler ... then put in anything that might burn. Anything that contains alcohol would help."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_141,coppelius,"That should generate enough steam to activate the pod."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_142,nathan,"First: Start a fire. Second: Put in highly flammable things ... I should be able to do that."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_143,nathan,"I'll try to get us out of here."
lab2,lib/lab2_voice.swf:lab2_144,coppelius,"Very good."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_000,nathan,"It's the long way back to the village."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_001,nathan,"I can't leave. Not yet."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_002,nathan,"It's dead."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_003,nathan,"The dry branches would make perfect firewood."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_004,nathan,"It's an old bridge, but the wood still looks strong and trustworthy."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_005,nathan,"I can only use it to get to the other side."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_006,nathan,"That cart has seen better days..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_007,nathan,"I wonder who left you here."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_008,nathan,"I can't use it. It's definitely broken."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_009,nathan,"Is that a coffin? Creepy."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_010,nathan,"It looks like it was opened from inside..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_011,nathan,"I'm not going in there!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_012,nathan,"There's something shiny stuck between the boards."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_013,nathan,"What's this?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_014,nathan,"It's the well handle."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_015,nathan,"Ooops!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_016,nathan,"It's the handle from the well."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_017,nathan,"Okay. It might be useful."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_018,nathan,"It's an old well."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_019,nathan,"Hello!? Is anyone down there?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_020,well,"..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_021,nathan,"No one is answering. Good."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_022,nathan,"I should use the handle."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_024,nathan,"It broke when I touched it."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_028,nathan,"It's a nice lantern."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_029,nathan,"I don't want to. I don't like darkness."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_030,nathan,"No, it's already lit."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_031,nathan,"It looks like he's on a hiking trip."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_032,nathan,"Excuse me..."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_033,greg,"Why hello!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_034,nathan,"No."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_035,nathan,"I don't want to duel him!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_037,nathan,"Those are nice looking mushrooms."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_038,nathan,"No, they might be poisonous."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_039,nathan,"I have no idea what kind of mushrooms these are."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_040,nathan,"I should only take what I really need."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_041,nathan,"It's a crow."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_042,nathan,"Someone has tied a golden chain with a key to his leg."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_043,nathan,"Hi there."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_044,nathan,"Come on ... you don't need this key, right?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_045,nathan,"No. He's going to bite my fingers off, I know it."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_046,nathan,"Try this, my friend."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_047,nathan,"It seems that he likes them... and I do believe that he looks slightly tired now."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_048,nathan,"How about another delicious and crunchy sedative seed?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_049,nathan,"He definitely looks tired now."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_050,nathan,"How about one more delicious and crunchy sedative seed?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_051,nathan,"Hmm... I guess he flew away to take a nap."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_052,nathan,"I'll have to find him."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_053,nathan,"A dry branch."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_055,nathan,"There's no light."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_056,nathan,"Now it's open."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_057,nathan,"That should work, but I'll have to open the lantern first."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_059,nathan,"It's already open."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_060,nathan,"Nice warm light."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_062,nathan,"No. I really don't like darkness."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_063,nathan,"There's no need to do that anymore."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_065,nathan,"I'm Nathan. Who are you?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_066,greg,"Hi Nathan. I'm Gregory, a traveller."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_067,nathan,"A pleasure to meet you. May I call you Greg?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_068,greg,"...Er, sure."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_069,nathan,"Where are you off to, Greg?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_070,greg,"Right now I'm heading to Leipzig to meet my friend, Matthew."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_071,greg,"We have a street performance act that we're taking on the road!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_072,nathan,"Neat, what's your act?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_073,greg,"I juggle fire while Matthew tells adventurous short stories."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_074,nathan,"Wow, that sounds great!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_075,greg,"Who knows, maybe you'll catch our act someday."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_076,nathan,"Are you connected to the mystery that surrounds this remote area?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_077,greg,"I don't think so, but I may be able to help."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_078,greg,"Whenever I ponder a mystery, I crack a can of soda to help me think."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_079,greg,"Here, try this!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_080,nathan,"Wow, thanks! A can of Dr. Pepper, my favorite!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_081,greg,"No problem, mate!"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_082,nathan,"Do you know a Dr. Coppelius?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_083,greg,"Sorry, I can't help. I'm just passing through these parts."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_084,nathan,"So ... you don't know him?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_085,greg,"Can't say that I do."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_086,nathan,"Okay, just thought I'd ask."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_087,nathan,"So, you're sure you don't know a Dr. Coppelius?"
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_088,greg,"Still no."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_089,nathan,"I see."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_090,nathan,"Well, I gotta go."
well,lib/well_voice.swf:well_091,greg,"See ya, Nathan!"
