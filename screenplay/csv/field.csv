field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_000,nathan,"It has a nice golden color."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_001,nathan,"I can hear crickets. I guess they live somewhere in there."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_002,nathan,"That's a good idea. I'll take some wheat."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_003,nathan,"I already have enough wheat."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_008,nathan,"The barrel is full of old tins and tools."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_009,nathan,"It's all rusty and useless."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_010,nathan,"Except, maybe, for that cocktail shaker on top."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_011,nathan,"It's a cocktail shaker, and it seems to be in good shape... unlike the rest of this scrap metal."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_012,nathan,"Alright."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_013,nathan,"Nice bench. It looks comfortable."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_014,nathan,"I don't want to rest now."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_015,nathan,"There are still mysteries to solve and plots to unfold."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_016,nathan,"It's a single glove."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_017,nathan,"Sorry, does this glove belong to you?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_018,nora,"No, it was already here when I came."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_019,nathan,"Good. Then I'll take it."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_020,nora,"Why? Is it your glove?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_021,nathan,"Uh ... yes?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_022,nora,"Then why did you ask if it's mine?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_023,nathan,"... to test your honesty?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_024,nathan,"You passed the test! Congratulations."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_025,nathan,"I'll take the glove, okay?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_026,nora,"*Sigh* Go ahead."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_027,nathan,"There's a scarecrow watching over this field."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_028,nathan,"If I were a bird, I'd be terrified."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_029,nathan,"It's pretty much useless... and far too big to pick up."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_030,nathan,"The sign says ""Path to Sea""."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_031,nathan,"There's some larger tools and bundles of wood. Nothing useful, I guess."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_032,nathan,"No, these tools are too heavy."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_033,nathan,"Mh ... it's a stone."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_034,nathan,"Hey, there's a wriggly worm under that stone!"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_035,nathan,"It's a worm. He's wriggling."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_036,nathan,"Okay. I have the worm."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_037,nathan,"Who's he?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_038,nathan,"Excuse me..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_039,nathan,"Who's she?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_040,nathan,"Ahem ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_041,nathan,"That wouldn't be very nice."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_042,nathan,"Something seems terribly wrong with Nora ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_043,nathan,"Are you alright, Nora?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_044,nora,"I ... I don't feel well ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_045,nora,"Please find my grandfather, Nathan ... he'll know what to do. See if he's around that house over there."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_046,GOODBYE,"Please hurry Nathan. Mr. McManus has to take grandfather and I back home. I ... I need my medicine."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_048,nathan,"Don't worry, Nora. I'll find your grandfather!"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_049,GET KEY,"And tell my grandfather that I found this ..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_051,nathan,"Is this some sort of key?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_052,nora,"I think so. I assume it has something to do with that house my grandfather was trying to get into."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_053,nathan,"Okay, I'll look around that house for your grandfather."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_054,HAS KEY,"What was I supposed to do with this key part?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_056,nora,"Please give it to my grandfather ... he was trying to find a way into that house."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_058,nathan,"It's a fence of barbed wire."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_059,nathan,"I've got enough barbed wire."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_060,nathan,"Good idea, I may need some barbed wire..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_061,nathan,"But I'll need something to protect my hands to free it."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_062,nathan,"A single glove is rather useless."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_063,nathan,"I hear gloves are usually used in pairs..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_064,nathan,"Like shoes, you know."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_068,nathan,"Who's your grandfather? What's his name?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_069,nora,"I'm not supposed to talk about him, sorry Nathan."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_070,nathan,"What is your grandfather doing here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_071,nora,"He has some business to do around here."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_072,nathan,"What kind of business?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_073,nora,"I'm not quite sure."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_074,nora,"He doesn't say much about his work... but he did tell me not to talk about him or his work with strangers."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_075,nora,"Actually, he told me not to talk to strangers at all."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_076,nathan,"But we can talk because I introduced myself, right?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_077,nora,"Right."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_078,nathan,"Isn't it kind of boring here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_079,nora,"I think it's nice ... and I have something to read while I'm waiting."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_080,nathan,"What are you reading?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_081,nora,"Mungo Park: ""Travels in the Interior of Africa"". I got it from my grandfather..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_082,nora,"That Mungo Park was a real adventurer."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_083,nathan,"What are you reading again?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_084,nora,"Mungo Park: ""Travels in the Interior of Africa""."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_085,nathan,"I've learned enough about you, I think."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_086,nathan,"Who are you and what are you doing here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_087,nora,"I'm Nora. I was reading as you might have noticed."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_088,nora,"But If you must know: I'm waiting for my grandfather."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_090,nathan,"Do you know a Dr. Coppelius?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_091,nora,"Why do you ask?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_092,nathan,"I was sent to tell him that he's in danger."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_093,nora,"In danger?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_094,nathan,"Yes. I don't know why, but he's supposed to contact the university immediately."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_095,nora,"I wish I could help you... but I've been asked not to talk about him. Sorry."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_096,nathan,"So you know him?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_097,nora,"Please, I can't answer that."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_098,nathan,"Okay, sorry."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_099,nathan,"You know, I can run really fast."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_100,nora,"I'm excited to hear that."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_101,nathan,"Really?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_102,nathan,"Bye."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_103,nathan,"I'm Nathan. Who are you?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_104,coppelius,"Young man, I am someone who knows that you don't belong here... so what are you doing here?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_105,nathan,"I'm searching for a Dr. Coppelius."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_106,coppelius,"Oh really? That's quite interesting, I must say."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_107,nathan,"Do you know this Coppelius? I was sent to warn him that he may be in grave danger."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_108,coppelius,"Of course I know him. He's quite a character..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_109,nathan,"Can you tell me where I could find him?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_110,coppelius,"What you should do right now is to get into that house over there. That would point you in the right direction."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_111,nathan,"But the house is locked..."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_112,coppelius,"I know there's a three-part key that unlocks it. I've heard that you already have at least one part of it. There's another part under the doormat."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_113,nathan,"Are you Nora's grandfather? Is she alright?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_114,coppelius,"Oh yes, I am.  But don't you worry about her, I can assure you that she's in good hands and will be well soon."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_115,nathan,"What's your name?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_116,coppelius,"That's none of your business. You should try to get into that house... you might find some more answers in there."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_117,nathan,"What's in the house? Why do you want me to get in there?"
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_118,coppelius,"YOU want to go in there. I'm just telling you it's the right thing to do."
field,lib/field_voice.swf:field_119,nathan,"I have to get going."
