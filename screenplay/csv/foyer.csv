foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_001,nathan,"This belongs into a museum! I'll take it with me."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_002,nathan,"No, wait. I should finish this adventure first."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_003,nathan,"Books on philosophy, mostly ethics, some on anatomy and literature theory."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_004,nathan,"There are a lot of scientific journals about biology and physics. They smell old, but in a positive way."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_005,nathan,"Oh and there's an 'Encyclopedia of Science'. Boring too, I guess."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_006,nathan,"If this bookcase holds a secret door, it won't be revealed simply by pushing on it."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_007,nathan,"This can't be the correct time ..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_008,nathan,"How can I correct the time if I have no idea what time it is?"
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_009,nathan,"""Your Own Secret Underground Lab"", ""More about Secret Underground Labs"" & ""How Do I Keep Rodents From Invading My Secret Underground Lab""."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_010,nathan,"No wonder these books are down there - they sound REALLY boring."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_011,nathan,"""The Inside Matters"". Sounds interesting!"
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_012,nathan,"Ok, I'll take it."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_013,nathan,"They're the metal plates from the socketed bird device."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_014,nathan,"It seems that Vincent took them out and simply dropped them here."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_015,nathan,"Ok."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_016,nathan,"There are two oval-shaped sockets in the base of this statue."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_017,nathan,"Hey, there's also an inscription..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_018,nathan,"""Even the spirit of youth and grim death listen to the birds' song. For without words it will teach wisdom. For without key it will open up the path of truth."" Wu Xun."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_019,nathan,"It looks like there's something missing here... both sockets are empty."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_020,nathan,"I've now filled one socket, but the other is still empty."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_021,nathan,"It looks like it's been completely activated."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_022,nathan,"Here we go."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_023,nathan,"One plate is still missing."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_024,nathan,"The bird's song opened up a secret passage, just like the inscription said."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_028,nathan,"If the mud was cleaned off this dirty object, then it might just fit into one of those sockets!"
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_029,nathan,"It's a beautiful golden bird sitting on a branch."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_030,nathan,"It seems to be part of a larger mechanical device controlling something in this room..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_032,nathan,"Open Sesame?"
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_033,nathan,"Hmm, that doesn't seem to work."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_034,nathan,"I assume that I'll need to fill those oval-shaped sockets in the base to activate whatever this mechanism is."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_035,nathan,"It's a buddha. It seems to be a very old statue."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_036,nathan,"Maybe later..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_037,nathan,"I use to question everything, so I'm not a religious person."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_038,nathan,"But even that's not for sure."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_039,nathan,"It would be exceptionally bad karma to steal Coppelius' buddha."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_040,nathan,"Old wine. It was bottled over 60 years ago."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_041,nathan,"I'm not stealing Dr. Coppelius' liquor!"
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_043,nathan,"The bottle contains a strange blue fluid."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_044,nathan,"No. That's not a good idea."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_045,nathan,"I'd guess it's some sort of cleaning fluid for combs."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_046,nathan,"I'm not a barber so I'll leave it right here."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_047,nathan,"Nice ivy."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_048,nathan,"These are all old letters. Some are even from Cairo ... another is from Delhi."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_049,nathan,"These are all letters addressed to Dr. Coppelius."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_050,nathan,"Hey! There are even some from my university... but the newest ones arrived here over one year ago."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_051,nathan,"It's a picture of a newborn child with its mother."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_052,nathan,"It's a picture of a middle-aged man. He looks healthy."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_053,nathan,"It's a picture of an old man. He looks tired."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_054,nathan,"It's a picture of a puppet. Without age and emotion."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_055,nathan,"Hey! It's the Beatles!"
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_056,nathan,"Except ... John Lennon is wearing an eyepatch and Ringo Starr is an old woman."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_057,nathan,"My mistake, these are really just old family photos."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_058,nathan,"This is a list of radio frequencies."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_059,nathan,"You can radio Glasgow, Hamburg, Venice ..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_060,nathan,"... and a place just called ""Island Radio Station"". Strange."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_061,nathan,"If I had a working radio then I might be able to use these."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_062,nathan,"It's a radio for transmitting and receiving radio messages."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_063,nathan,"It doesn't work. There's no power."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_064,nathan,"It's full of small tools."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_065,nathan,"To be honest, I'm not very good with mechanical things."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_066,nathan,"I don't have the slightest idea of what some of these tools are used for."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_067,nathan,"I wonder what Dr. Coppelius is working on here..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_068,nathan,"Whatever it is, there sure are a lot of cogs and springs inside."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_069,nathan,"I'd better not. I have no idea what it is."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_070,nathan,"""Wahrheit währt am längsten"""
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_071,nathan,"It translates as ""Truth will last longer than anything"". I guess it's an old german proverb."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_072,nathan,"The books up there are about different cultures all over the world. Southern Ghana, Mexico, Hokkaido, Wales and others."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_073,nathan,"Ah! Finally some fiction. He has a good collection. From Kafka, Chesterton, E.T.A. Hoffmann and Hemingway ..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_074,nathan,"... to Gaiman and Carroll. And then back to the classics: Shakespeare, Goethe and Steve Martin."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_075,nathan,"Hmm, Winnie the Pooh is missing. This Coppelius is a strange man."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_076,nathan,"I'd never get around to reading them."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_077,nathan,"There are several markers in different regions of western africa."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_078,nathan,"I wonder if Dr. Coppelius has been there ..."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_079,nathan,"These impressive masks are made from wood and straw."
foyer,lib/foyer_voice.swf:foyer_080,nathan,"Probably African."
