ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_000,nathan,"Over there is a lighthouse."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_001,nathan,"It's too far away. They wouldn't hear me."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_002,nathan,"I don't think I'll hike over there ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_003,nathan,"It was a massive stone bridge. It's collapsed."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_004,nathan,"I think that way leads to that village I saw on the map at home ... Ravenhollow."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_005,nathan,"I can't cross the bridge."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_006,nathan,"Ah, the sea."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_007,nathan,"No, the water looks really cold."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_008,nathan,"I've never done this before..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_009,nathan,"I guess I won't need that stupid fishing rod anymore."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_010,sailor,"I would have paid fifty bucks for it."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_011,nathan,"I'll just pretend like I didn't hear that."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_012,nathan,"I'll need to bait the hook before I can try fishing."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_013,nathan,"I'll need a float and bait before I can try fishing."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_014,nathan,"This fishing tackle is still incomplete."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_016,nathan,"Seems like there was a ferry coming here once."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_017,nathan,"Must have been a long time ago. I can't read the timetable anymore."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_018,nathan,"I can't read it. Even if I could it would still be useless."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_019,nathan,"I'm sure the ferry doesn't come here anymore."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_020,nathan,"It's a leaflet from the local fishing club."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_021,nathan,"I'll take it. I doubt anyone else needs it."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_022,nathan,"The leaflet was pinned to the board with a small fishing hook."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_023,nathan,"Somehow I feel like someone is watching me..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_024,nathan,"I'll have to take the long way through the fields ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_025,nathan,"There's a boat at anchor."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_026,sailor,"Aye. That's me ship, the ""Sea Cucumber""."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_027,nathan,"Excuse me! May I borrow your boat?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_028,sailor,"Sorry. I can't lend you my boat."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_029,sailor,"Shroom and me, we'll have to get going soon..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_030,sailor,"We have to deliver these boxes before sunrise."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_031,nathan,"It's a rowboat."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_036,nathan,"He's asleep."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_037,nathan,"It looks like he's running in his dream."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_038,shroom,"..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_039,nathan,"Hey old boy!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_040,nathan,"Want to help me?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_041,sailor,"Old Shroom is tired. He won't help you if you have nothin' to offer."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_042,nathan,"What would he like to have?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_043,sailor,"He's a sailor, like me. Therefore he loves fish... Just like me."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_044,sailor,"Right boy?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_046,nathan,"I'll let him sleep."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_047,nathan,"Here, I heard you like fish..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_048,nathan,"Good idea ... but I think he's too tired."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_049,nathan,"It seems that I have his attention now."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_050,nathan,"Shroom, old chap. How are you?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_052,nathan,"That's great to hear."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_053,nathan,"I'd better not."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_054,nathan,"Ahem ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_055,nathan,"Shroom! Come on, old boy! Find the SETA DE MUERTE!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_056,nathan,"See? ... the name is in this book here! Have a good look at it."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_057,nathan,"Wow, Shroom found a mushroom."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_058,nathan,"How convenient that it was hidden right under his nose."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_064,nathan,"No, he's done enough."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_065,nathan,"He looks a little dangerous."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_066,sailor,"What did you just say?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_067,nathan,"Nothing! Sorry!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_068,nathan,"Excuse me..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_069,nathan,"I don't think so."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_073,nathan,"How did Nora get here?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_074,sailor,"Her grandfather brought her and told me to wait for him."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_075,nathan,"Her grandfather? What did he look like?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_076,sailor,"Well, he looks a little bit like the first Doctor Who."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_077,nathan,"Who?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_078,sailor,"Aye! Just like him."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_079,nathan,"I'm confused."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_081,nathan,"Okay."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_082,nathan,"It's an old glove."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_083,nathan,"Ok."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_084,nathan,"The crab is living in an old glove."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_085,nathan,"Nature never fails to impress me."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_086,nathan,"Hey ... nice weather, hu?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_087,crab,"......."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_088,nathan,"It seems he's not interested in small talk."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_089,nathan,"It seems that he doesn't want to leave the glove."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_090,nathan,"Maybe I could persuade him to move out somehow..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_091,nathan,"Good idea, but the can is closed and full of Dr. Pepper."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_092,nathan,"Good idea, but the can is full of Dr. Pepper."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_093,nathan,"Well, maybe I could give away an empty can."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_094,nathan,"Let's see ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_095,nathan,"Now the crab is living comfortably in a Dr. Pepper can."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_096,nathan,"He has a good taste."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_100,nathan,"No. He's had more than enough adventures for one day."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_101,nathan,"It seems she's not feeling well."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_102,nathan,"Nora, may I ask you something?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_103,nora,"Not right now please, Nathan."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_104,nathan,"Sorry."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_105,nathan,"That wouldn't be nice."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_106,nathan,"These boxes contain unmarked bottles."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_107,nathan,"It smells like strong whiskey."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_108,nathan,"I'll take one."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_109,sailor,"No, you won't."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_111,nathan,"Right, I won't."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_112,nathan,"Well, he said I can have one..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_113,nathan,"I've already taken my share."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_114,nathan,"Hi, I'm Nathan. And you are ..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_115,sailor,"I'm Martin Munchkin McManus."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_116,nathan,"Is your name really ""Munchkin""?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_117,sailor,"Aye."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_118,nathan,"Your parents must have liked ""The Wizard of Oz""."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_119,sailor,"I have no idea what you are talking about, kid."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_120,nathan,"Is your name really Martin ""Munchkin"" McManus?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_124,nathan,"Is that your dog?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_125,sailor,"Aye. T'is me mate."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_126,nathan,"What is his name?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_127,sailor,"His name is Shroom. Right boy?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_129,nathan,"Shroom? As in Mushroom?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_130,sailor,"Aye. He's a mushroom searching kind of dog."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_131,nathan,"Really?! I've heard of those!"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_132,sailor,"Aye. If you show old Shroom here the name of the mushroom that you're searching for, he'll be on his feet in a second to find it for you."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_133,nathan,"He has to see it written down somewhere? That means he can read, too! Wow."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_135,nathan,"You said your dog can find mushrooms?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_137,nathan,"Fascinating..."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_138,nathan,"I'm kind of stuck right now. Can you help?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_139,sailor,"I've been at the shores of Africa, I've wrestled the boxers of China, and I've seen the ghost of the pirate captain Stoertebecker."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_140,sailor,"...but still the most useful ideas and hints I've ever found are in the book ""Capt'n Matt's Guide to Life""."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_141,sailor,"Here, I happen to have a copy that I could give you."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_142,nathan,"Wow, thanks! ""Capt'n Matt's Guide to Life"". This sounds good. Sometimes I need guidance."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_143,sailor,"Aye. We all do, kid."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_144,nathan,"Don't you need this book? It sounds like it's important to you."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_145,sailor,"Aye. It is, but I have about fifty more copies at home. You can keep it, boy."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_146,nathan,"So giving me this copy won't diminish your collection?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_147,sailor,"Naw, I like to give them to strangers whenever possible. It spreads the word."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_148,nathan,"It's dark. You are standing at an old pier. Alone. With a couple of boxes containing unlabeled bottles of alcohol."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_149,nathan,"Hey! Are you doing something illegal?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_150,sailor,"Aye aye."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_151,nathan,"May I have a bottle?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_152,sailor,"Aye. Take one. Ten percent of the goods are meant to be used to bribe officials and those who know too much."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_154,nathan,"Aren't you afraid that I'm going to report you?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_155,sailor,"No. You've officially been bribed."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_156,nathan,"I guess you're right. And I might need a bottle."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_157,nathan,"So you aren't afraid that I'm going to report your shady activities?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_158,sailor,"No. I said you could take a bottle. You've been officially bribed."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_160,nathan,"Bye."
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_161,nathan,"How are you?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_163,nathan,"Do you know what time it is?"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_164,shroom,"......"
ferry,lib/ferry_voice.swf:ferry_165,nathan,"That late?"
